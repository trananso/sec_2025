At PineWave Mobility in Waterloo, we’re searching for someone who loves building clean, efficient mobile interfaces. You’ll work alongside our senior iOS and Android developers to improve our existing apps and help experiment with new product ideas. The position is full-time, hybrid, and starts in the $70–$82K range depending on experience.

This is a great fit if you already have experience with Swift or Kotlin and enjoy solving UX challenges on small screens. Some experience with API integration is a plus, but we’re happy to mentor you as long as you’re comfortable learning independently.

Benefits include health and dental coverage, remote work flexibility, and an annual learning stipend. Some automated tools may be used to organize applications, but every candidate will be reviewed by a real human team member. This posting is for an existing vacancy. If you require accommodation during the hiring process, just let us know at careers@pinewave.ca.
